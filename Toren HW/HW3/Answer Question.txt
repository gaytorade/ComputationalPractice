-What code draws the blades of grass?
line(x, height - 10, x + random(-10, 10), height - 10 - random(h));


- What code makes the "lawnmower" come by? How often does it come by?
if (random() > 0.999) {
    noStroke();
    fill(255);
    rect(-1, -1, width + 2, height - 15);
    h = 10;
  }
Randomly, because It will come when random() > 0.999

- What's the point of the h variable?
h is height of grass after grow up

What do the three numerical arguments of colorMode do?
In HSB color mode. It is hue, saturation, and brightness.

What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h)? Why is it there?
Minus 10 to make sure that the grass grow on the top of ground, because height of ground is 10.
